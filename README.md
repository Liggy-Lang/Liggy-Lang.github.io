# 🎉 Hey there, I'm Liggy-Lang!

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  
If you ended up here, then you’ve either clicked a link, followed a breadcrumb trail of code, or maybe just got curious. Either way — **hi** 👋 and thanks for stopping by!

## 🧑‍💻 So… who even am I?

I’m just a person who loves building stuff with code. Sometimes it’s useful, sometimes it’s weird, sometimes I build things just because I can. I enjoy experimenting, learning new tech, and figuring out how to make computers do cool things.

## 💻 Things I Use (a lot... probably too much)

Here’s a random list of programming languages and tools I mess with regularly (and sometimes obsess over):

- **JavaScript** – You click, I react. Perfect for making websites alive.
- **Python** – Simple, chill, and always up for solving weird problems.
- **C++** – When I want my code to run *really* fast... or punish myself.
- **HTML/CSS** – The internet wouldn’t look good without these two besties.
- **And more!** – I’m always learning something new. Who knows what I'll add next?

## 🔍 What’s in my repos?

You’ll find all sorts of things here:

- 💡 Cool ideas I turned into code (or at least tried to)
- 🔧 Random tools and scripts I made for fun or laziness
- 🎮 Mini-games and fun projects
- 🧪 Test stuff that may or may not break your computer (just kidding… I think)
- 📚 Practice projects from when I’m learning new tech

## 🎯 Why I Code

Because it’s awesome.  
Seriously — the fact that we can type words into a screen and make real things happen still blows my mind. I love turning ideas into reality (or at least into semi-working prototypes 😅). Whether it’s a new game, a helpful tool, or just a fun experiment, I enjoy the process of building and learning.

## 🕹️ Fun Fact About Me

If I could code on a beach with a smoothie in one hand and a laptop in the other… I totally would. 🌴🥤💻  
Also, I once spent hours fixing a bug that was just a missing semicolon. True story.
